Question: You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
Return the merged string.

My Solution: 

class Solution(object):
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1, word2):
        i = 0
        j = 0
        res = ""
        while i < len(word1) and j < len(word2) :
            res +=word1[i] + word2[j]
            i +=1
            j +=1
        while i < len(word1):
                res += word1[i]
                i +=1
        while j < len(word2) :
                res += word2[j]
                j +=1
        return res

# Problem2.python
Question: You are given two strings s and t. String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position. Return the letter that was added to t.

My Solution: 

class Solution(object):
    def findTheDifference(self, s, t):
        count = {}

        for ch in s:
            count[ch] = count.get(ch, 0) + 1

 
        for ch in t:
            if ch not in count or count[ch] == 0:
                return ch
            count[ch] -= 1

# Problem3.python
Question: Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

My Solution:

class Solution(object):
    def strStr(self, haystack, needle):
        if needle == "":
            return 0

        n = len(haystack)
        m = len(needle)

        for i in range(n - m + 1):
            if haystack[i:i+m] == needle:
                return i

        return -1
